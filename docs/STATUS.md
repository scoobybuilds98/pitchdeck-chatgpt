# Project Status

## Done
- Core Next.js app scaffold with global layout, navigation, and section routing.
- Business registry and data loaders to make sections data-driven.
- Section layouts and reusable UI components for overview, market, model, operations,
  projections, charts, assumptions, and appendix pages.
- Narrative and visualization scaffolding (cards, grids, tables, empty states).
- Mainland Truck starter data templates for projections, assumptions, charts, tables,
  and narrative placeholders.

## In Progress
- Data ingestion from source documents into the Mainland Truck dataset.
- Chart rendering and interactive projection editing.

## Next Up
- Extract projections, assumptions, and narrative content from source docs into
  `data/businesses/mainland-truck/`.
- Implement editable projection inputs with persistence and validation.
- Replace placeholder market signals and business model items with real data.
- Add chart rendering components wired to projection data.
- Run full QA pass (build, lint, and manual UI review) before investor demo.
